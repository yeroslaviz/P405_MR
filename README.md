Analyzing the data for Marion R. project. 

```
Those samples are mouse embryonic stem cells and I would like to compare what is being transcribed during some different treatments (deprivation of different amino acid). I am especially focused on the stress responses, survival/cell deaths pathways.
I have 6 groups of triplicates. The untreated group is A, the treated groups are C, T, M, CM, TM (C, T and M are single treatments and CM and TM are combined treatments).
I have different questions to answer so I thought of different types of comparisons:
First, I am interested in the effects of C and T treatments so I think the differences between C vs A and T vs A (and M vs A) will help
Second, I am interested in the contribution of M during those treatments. I am not sure whatâ€™s best but maybe the differences between CM vs C and TM vs T first, then CM vs TM?
Do you usually send a table with normalized counts for all samples at once or is it separate for each comparison? Let me know if you need more information on the project. Thank you so much!
